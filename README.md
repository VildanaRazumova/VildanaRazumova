- 👋 Hi, I’m Vildana Razumova
- 👀 I’m interested in Data and Beautiful stuff (Home interior and Fashion)
- :bank: In my previous life I was working 10 years at the banking sector, but when I tried working in an IT Startup,
  I fell in love with this atmosphere and the vibe
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science at Gisma University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IT teams and people from different countries
- :mortar_board: Fact: I'm 34 years old and I am still a student, the main reason for this fact is my passion for new knowledge.
